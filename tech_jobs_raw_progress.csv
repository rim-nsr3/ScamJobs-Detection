This is not another startup launch. This is a call to action for those who understand that we are at the edge of a precipice—and we must choose which way to leap. The global food system is broken, the atmosphere is polluted, and the biological health of mankind is spiralling.But what if we could rewire life at the cellular level without touching a single gene? What if we could amplify the natural brilliance of plants, increase their healing capacity, and remove the stranglehold of big ag, big pharma, and big tech—all through the power of light?Our patented Wavelength Emitting Electronic Device™ (W.E.E.D.) is not just a grow light. It's a biological tool of liberation. It emits a highly targeted spectrum of monochromatic light (465nm, 485nm, 670nm), at very high amplitudes, tuned precisely to stimulate photoreceptors inside plant cells—unlocking faster growth, deeper nutrient density, and even new biological traits. This device triggers advanced photosynthesis, speeds up development, and creates plant matter unlike anything grown under the sun or conventional LEDs.We are offering a rare opportunity to become part of this unfolding revolution. To test it. To study it. To experiment with it. To co-create the next generation of agricultural biotech.Calling All Indoor FarmersA Rare Invitation to Be the First to Grow the FutureWe’re calling on a select few exceptional indoor cultivation businesses to become early adopters in our Genesis Pioneer Program — a groundbreaking initiative that offers you direct access to the most advanced photosynthetic lighting technology ever developed: the Wavelength Emitting Electronic Device™ (W.E.E.D.).This is not just a new grow light. This is a patented optoelectronic system engineered to unlock deeper genetic expression, speed up plant growth cycles, and drastically enhance nutrient density of all plant life, at all stages of growth — all without chemicals, GMOs, or gimmicks. For those of you already growing amazing things, this is your chance to push the boundaries of what your plants can truly become. As a plug and play it will make anything your growing do better.We are looking for one standout business from each of the following sectors: Cannabis Cultivators: Seeking higher terpene counts, better trichome density, and more potent cannabinoid profiles — naturally. Hemp Growers: Interested in exploring how targeted light stimulation can elevate fiber, flower, or CBD yields without synthetic alteration. Microgreen Producers: Focused on medicinal nutrition and extreme efficiency? Let us help you grow even more potent superfoods in even less time. Mushroom Growers: We are fascinated by how photo-biology interacts with fungal development, and we want you to explore that with us. Vegetable & Herb Growers: Imagine greens that stay fresher longer, basil that packs more flavor, and lettuces that store more antioxidants — all grown with enhanced photosynthesis. Medicinal/Healing Plant Farmers: If you grow plants with a purpose — ayurvedic herbs, rare ethnobotanicals, traditional medicine strains — we want to help you amplify their healing power.What We Provide: A free Wavelength Emitting Electronic Device™ Early access to additional units before commercial release Technical support and direct collaboration with our R&D team Features in our media campaigns, publications, and scientific outreach Priority consideration for exclusive long-term partnershipsWhat We Ask in Return: Maintain a bi-weekly grow log with detailed photos, notes, and honest observations Participate in structured and exploratory experiments Commit to a minimum testing period of 6-12 months Be open to a two-way relationship — your input shapes the future of this technologyThis is not a sales pitch. This is a call to arms for growers who know something is broken in our food and plant systems — and are ready to do something about it.Reach out if you’re ready to grow with us.To the Scientific TrailblazersJoin a Movement of Real ResearchWe are actively recruiting:• Independent researchers• Grad and undergrad biology/biotech students• Non-professional home grown researchers, alchemists & wizards• Private lab directors and retired scientists• Institutions focused on plant sciences, bioenergetics, or agtechThis is more than a research assistantship. This is your chance to contribute to real-world breakthroughs that could reshape agriculture, food systems, and human biology.As a member of our R&D cohort, you'll receive a complimentary Wavelength Emitting Electronic Device™, access to structured experiments, and full collaboration with Genesis leadership.You may: Lead research on light-induced plant morphogenesis Explore cDNA pathway modification via light stimulation Work toward authorship in patents and peer-reviewed papers Contribute to the creation of plant-based regenerative foods Potential partnerships with genesis leadershipThis work bypasses GMO and CRISPR tech to explore upstream RNA and protein response pathways triggered through photonic influence. Our theory? That light alone, when finely tuned, can act as a biological architect.We want bright minds with fierce hearts.

Help me rewrite this to the official final version of the e add to hire.Who is up to the latest information on optical storage and its future?  I need a total expert here somebody with greater current knowledge of discs than myself who has used computers for 50 years.MY DATA PRODUCTION VOLUMEI have lots of data that needs to be backed up for decades; I do not produce more than a gigabyte per month so writing a few optical discs for back up is fine every year.I produce data all the time; once produced after a year it should be frozen in place forever decades in the future; I do not need to edit it again unlike some people who need to keep editing most of their dataI am interested in very long term is archival storage.Most of it will be frozen forever as is and does not need to be edited again in the future hence DVD+-ROM is fine.MY COMPUTER BACKGROUNDI have been using computers for over 45 years.STORAGE BACKGROUND:I HAVE gone through cassette tape storage, to floppies, to Iomega in days long gone and never to be used again.Now I use SSD, optical, and HDD but the world keeps changingMY BACK UP KNOWLEDGE:  PLEASE INFORM IF WRONGNON-OPTICAL METHODOLOGIESmy current understanding of the decade’s long reliabilityI have heard that SSD drives are the least reliable for long term off site back up due to bit decay I never used tape backup; and do not need that quantity of storage.I have heard physical hard drives are the best.OPTICAL METHODOLOGIESI am confused how long optical will last and be readable.I am confused as whether archival quality blank media and drives be produced in the future.ALL BACK UP FORMSI USE CURRENTLYcould storage, spinning hard drives, and SSD drivesI have never used tape backup and would appreciate any info on its continued viability.I have been using 100-year GOLD DVDS for many years.\FUTURE USEI have considered using M-DiscI have considered using Blue RayCLOUD NOT AN OPTIONI do not want to use the cloud since this is all medical data and personal financial data that should be kept almost permanently off line.OTHER METHODSI can of course use other methods than optical but I am only focused on optical in this add.

Take Part in Our Clinical Trial!Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). Unlike Type 1 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in childhood and is autoimmune in nature, Type 2 typically develops in adulthood and is strongly linked to lifestyle factors—especially being overweight or obese.

When a person carries excess body fat, especially around the abdomen, it can lead to insulin resistance. This means the body’s cells don’t respond properly to insulin, the hormone that helps sugar move from the bloodstream into the cells. As a result, blood sugar levels rise, which over time can lead to serious health complications like heart disease, nerve damage, kidney issues, and vision problems.


We are seeking volunteers for a clinical study to assess the safety and Type 2 diabetes.

In Type 1 Diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to high blood sugar levels and a lifelong need for insulin therapy. When combined with obesity, managing blood sugar can become more complex and may increase the risk of complications such as insulin resistance, heart disease, and high blood pressure.

Careful monitoring, healthy lifestyle changes, and individualized treatment plans are important to manage both conditions effectively.

We are seeking volunteers for a clinical study to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational treatment for Type 1 Diabetes with Obesity.

Join Our Clinical Study Today!Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks the tissues around the eyes, causing inflammation and swelling. It’s most often linked to Graves' disease but can also occur in people with normal or low thyroid function.  Common symptoms include bulging eyes, eye redness, swelling, double vision, and, in severe cases, vision loss. TED usually has two phases: an active phase where symptoms worsen and an inactive phase where inflammation stops but lasting changes may remain.  Risk factors include smoking, being female, middle age, and thyroid problems. Treatment can involve managing thyroid levels, medications to reduce inflammation, biologic therapies like teprotumumab, and sometimes surgery. Early diagnosis and care from specialists are important to protect vision and improve outcomes.
